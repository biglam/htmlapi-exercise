# Class Rules

  1. Respect fellow classmates and instructional team. Instructional team will be patient and courteous with students.
    - We should all encourage a collaborative environment within the classroom.
  2. Arrive on time. Latecomers really distract the class.
  3. Silence mobiles. Absolutely no calls in class.
  4. One person talks at a time during teaching time.
  5. No distracting games or videos.
  6. No food at desks (no hot/smelly food in class at all), no drinks at desk (apart from lidded water bottles).
