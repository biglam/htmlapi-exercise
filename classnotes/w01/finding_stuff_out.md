## Pop Quiz
  - Hands up if there's a subject you know *really* well
  - Keep your hand up if you know *everything* about the subject...
    - Really... *everything*? You wrote the book? *phew* you can take a break
    - everyone else... this lesson is for you
    

## Getting Answers

Let's think of some ways that we can think of solving our problems:
  - problem: You're working on a photo-sharing social networking app, and you want to only allow users to upload image files (preventing them uploading documents and executables)
  - but you don't know how... how could you solve this problem

  
  - Things like:
    - ask co-workers
    - ask the community (on the internet)
    - look up documentation ('man')
    - "google" - look on the internet

The difference in these answers seems to be that one type is focused on relying on others... the other is finding for ourselves

  - let's learn how to fish, so we can feed ourselves
   
  
## What's the cost of asking others?

Programmers don't work in a vacuum - we generally have colleagues around, and we can rely on them to help us when we ask (we hope!).

But unless they're working on the same topic, it costs them time to get out of one train of thought, and onto the other, and then back again

Good will... the more you ask someone, the less inclined they get to answer.

RTFM and STFW - these are two phrases that might get directed at you if you ask colleagues too often.


## How to solve our own problems

> "*We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris*"  
> Larry Wall (creator of Perl)

Other programmers being lazy help you by...

* writing **reusable** software for common tasks
* writing clear **code**, **documentation** and **tutorials** so they don't get bothered with questions
* answering questions in **public forums** so they only need answering once

Help yourself by being Lazy & Impatient

- Instructors aren't always going to be here
- Are we the first person to have this problem? Are we unique, beautiful snowflakes?
  - No? So investigate who has before.

* don't reinvent the wheel
* problem? Quickly search for existing solutions online
* read the docs - common use-cases and gotchas are usually covered
* read the source - good code can be _almost_ self-documenting
* still stuck? Ask someone else to solve the problem

What good is hubris?

- Excessive pride? How can this be good.
- You can have the belief that there is not a single coding problem you cannot solve.
- You will be coding gods (nijas, rockstars, etc :-)


## Google is your friend

"Let me Google that for you..."

Google is usually the fastest route to your solution - skip this stage at your peril!

If you ask someone for help, and *haven't* looked for solutions yourself online, you'll most likely get these aggressive responses: RTFM, STFW...

... or a more passive-aggresive link sent to you: ["How do I reverse an array in Ruby?"](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+I+reverse+an+array+in+ruby) :-)

Keyword choice is... key


### Google-fu

* use standard terms
* include error message (in quotes)
* include language
* include library if you know it
* include version numbers if necessary

So: 'rails api array last item' might be a good search term if you need to get the last item from an array in Ruby.

    
### Common resources
  - [http://ruby-doc.org]
  - [http://api.rubyonrails.org]
  - [http://apidock.com/rails/browse]
  - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web]

Part of this course is learning how to solve your own problems

* practice finding things
* ask peers and instructors for keyword advice rather than the answer


### Test

A colleague comes up to you and says:

"Whoa, I've been playing with this awesome app called 'fossil' as an alternative to git."

Go find out about it on the web...

  [The answer](www.fossil-scm.org)


#### Asking for help

If searching for yourself doesn't get you what you need, you may have to ask a question. There are fast ways to get answers, and slower ways.

FAST ways to get answers - interact live with fellow programmers

* ask an instructor - special case!
* ask a colleague
* use private chat room (e.g. HipChat, Slack, Whatsapp)
* use public chat room for tool/language (e.g. IRC)

SLOW ways to get answers - post request and wait for response on...

* Q&A sites (Stackoverflow)
* user groups
* forums
* issue tracker

Whoever you ask, [ask smart questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

  - Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.
  - Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: “Fedora Core 7”, “Slackware 9.1”, etc.).
  - Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.
  - Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.
  - Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.
  - If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.


### Give back

When you do have a problem, would it be good to leave the answer for the next guy? (or future you - because I bet you have this problem again in the future, and you can't be expected to remember everything)

  - where can you do this? blog it, or write about it, or contribute to the community
  - register on Stack Overflow, and answer other peoples' questions


### Reassurance!

For the duration of this course... of course the instructor team is there to answer your questions; we won't tell you bluntly to RT*M!

But we would *love* to see you starting to put the research in to solving your own problems, because in most cases...

The answer's out there!
